# Refer_Market

Description: 
This is the perfect IOS app for you if you want to use some companyâ€™s product but cannot find a friend to refer you. You will find all the referral information here and get the benefit of getting referred. 

In this app I used a sqlite3 local database to store all the referral information, and I utilized Facebook's SDK to facilitate the user function. I am planning to use Parse to store each user's user information and enble them to see their own customized refer link and refer recommendation.

This is just a demo app and in the future I will attach more refer information to the app and add the Like and comment function. So that the most favored Refer information will be topped. Users will also be able to post their own refer links under each company categories, and there will be a polling mechanism for a certain user's referral link to be chosen.
